### CUDA installation
You may want to see the detailed blog [here](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/hpc/How-to-install-CUDA-9-2-on-Ubuntu-18-04-1184/).   
Take CUDA 10.1 installation for example. 
1. Download the [CUDA 10.1 Ubuntu 18.04 source](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.1-download-archive-base?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&target_distro=Ubuntu&target_version=1804&target_type=runfilelocal)  
2. `sudo sh cuda_10.1.105_418.39_linux.run`   
3. Set the path to `~/.bashrc`:
    ```
    # for cuda path
    cuda=cuda-10.1
    export PATH=/usr/local/$cuda/bin:$PATH
    export CUDADIR=/usr/local/$cuda
    export NUMBAPRO_NVVM=$CUDADIR/nvvm/lib64/libnvvm.so
    export NUMBAPRO_LIBDEVICE=$CUDADIR/nvvm/libdevice/
    export NVCCDIR=$CUDADIR/bin/nvcc
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/$cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export CPATH=/usr/local/$cuda/include:$CPATH
    export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/$cuda
    # for CUDA_DEVICES
    export CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER=PCI_BUS_ID
    ```   

### Anaconda
Download the anaconda individual version from [Anaconda official website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).   
1. Install: `bash xxx.sh`, e.g., `bash bash Anaconda3-2020.07-Linux-x86_64.sh`. Suggest keeping the default settings.   
2. make sure to add anaconda path to `~/.bashrc`. If you forgot to do so, just add the below into bashrc:  
    ```
    # >>> conda initialize >>>
    # !! Contents within this block are managed by 'conda init' !!
    __conda_setup="$('/home/qiang/anaconda3/bin/conda' 'shell.bash' 'hook' 2> /dev/null)"
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        eval "$__conda_setup"
    else
        if [ -f "/home/qiang/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" ]; then
            . "/home/qiang/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"
        else
            export PATH="/home/qiang/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
        fi
    fi
    unset __conda_setup
    # <<< conda initialize <<<
    ```
    Note: Please change the `/home/qiang/anaconda3` to your own path to anaconda3.  

The official guide how to use anaconda is [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).  


### Git Support (GitHub) 
Using `git` command to pull, push and manage your code. 
Here is [an introduction to git](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners).  
CheatSheet for `git` is [here](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf).   

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is the largest code sharing, management and version control platform.  
You may have to add `ssh` to github, otherwise each time you use git command, you have to input your account information. Here is the [instruction](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).  

Set your git global username and email address. This is to let Git know who you are. (If you do not change this, you can still git pull and git push as along as you add your ssh into github. However, github will not be able to appreciate your commits in commit history, they will think it is someone else make the changes not you.) To set the username and email:  
`git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"`  
`git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"`
