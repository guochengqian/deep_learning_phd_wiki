How to use Ibex
=================

Termius
--------

I would recomment a software called `termius`_ to all of you. This
software keep you away from inputing account and password every time you
want to login in the cluster.

You have to add host in termius. Add address, click ssh, add username
and password once in termius, then you just need to click the host name
then you can login into cluster(ibex). For example:

-  address: glogin.ibex.kaust.edu.sa
-  username: qiang
-  password: xxxxxxxx

After setting up, only a click is needed to ssh into the ibex system.

Apply for resources in cluster
------------------------------

You can either use sbatch or srun to run your program in cluster.

1. sbatch
    First option is using sbatch to send your job. Sbatch send your job in
    the priority queue and your code will continue to run even if you lose
    connection with cluster for some reason.

    There is an example of sbatch file:

    ::

       #!/bin/bash --login
       #SBATCH -N 1
       ##SBATCH --array=1  # repeat the task
       #SBATCH -J rloc
       #SBATCH -o log/%x.%3a.%A.out    # make sure the log folder exists
       #SBATCH -e log/%x.%3a.%A.err
       #SBATCH --time=5-0:00:00
       #SBATCH --gpus=8            # or: --gres=gpu:v100:8
       #SBATCH --gpus-per-node=8   # use gpu_wide
       #SBATCH --cpus-per-gpu=6
       #SBATCH --mem-per-gpu=45G
       #SBATCH --mail-user=xxx@kaust.edu.sa    # send message to your email
       #SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
       #SBATCH -A conf-gpu-2020.11.23
       #SBATCH --constraint=[ref_32T]  # use shared folder in v100s.

       # activate your conda env
       echo "Loading anaconda..."

       module purge
       module load gcc
       module load cuda/10.1.105
       module load anaconda3
       conda activate deepgcn

       echo "...Anaconda env loaded"
       python -u examples/classification/train.py  --phase train --train_path /scratch/dragon/intel/lig/guocheng/data/deepgcn/modelnet40
       echo "...training function Done"

    | Run ``sbatch train_ibex.sh`` then your job will be put in the queue.
    | You can check your queue info by : ``squeue -u xxx(your account)``
    | You can check the available GPUs by: ``gpu-usage --nodes|grep v100``

    See `KAUST IBEX offical doc`_ for detailed information. See the `IBEX
    Best Practice`_ for the detailed configuration of best usage on IBEX.

2. srun
    srun allow you to use cluster just like in terminal on your local
    machine. srun is convenient to use, however it will stop run when you
    lose connection with ibex. You need tmux to protect the node. When
    you lose connection, you can use tmux to login back into the node.
    There is a `tmux cheatsheet`_.

    You can srun into your allocated node using:
    ``srun --jobid=yourjobid --time=00:25:00 --mem 48g --cpus-per-task=6 --pty bash``
    To do that, you have to use Sbatch at first to query for resources and
    start your training there. The srun is just used as a tube. After you
    srun into the node, you can check your mem usage, etc.
